            <p id="home-p">Hercules (or Heracles in Greek mythology) was the son of Zeus, king of the gods, and a mortal woman, Alcmene. From birth, Hercules faced the wrath of Hera, Zeus’ wife, who was jealous of his existence. As a child, Hercules showed his strength by strangling two serpents sent by Hera to kill him. As an adult, Hera struck again, driving Hercules into madness, and causing him to kill his wife and children. To atone for this, Hercules was ordered to complete the Twelve Labors, a series of nearly impossible tasks by King Eurystheus. These included slaying the Nemean Lion, capturing the Golden Hind, retrieving the Apples of the Hesperides, and capturing Cerberus, the three-headed dog guarding the Underworld. With his immense strength and cunning, Hercules succeeded in all twelve tasks. Even after his labors, Hercules’ life was filled with challenges. He remarried Deianira, but their marriage ended in tragedy when she accidentally poisoned him with a tunic dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus. In excruciating pain, Hercules built a pyre and asked to be burned alive. Zeus, seeing his son’s suffering, granted him immortality, and Hercules ascended to Mount Olympus, where he became a god. Hercules is remembered as a symbol of strength, endurance, and redemption, whose heroic feats continue to inspire.</p>
